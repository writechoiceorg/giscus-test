Enhancing content accessibility is a priority for us, aiming to cater to the widest possible audience. Accessibility in writing extends beyond text conversion; it encompasses content organization and guidance for various readers, including those with diverse mental and physical abilities. Legal requirements may vary by audience and region, but at a minimum, an accessible version should always be available.

## Core Principles

We create content for a diverse readership, including those who rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation, Braille interfaces, and individuals with varying cognitive capabilities. When writing, consider these key aspects:

- **Clarity for All Audiences:** Ensure your content makes sense to readers unfamiliar with your organization.
- **Scannability:** Create content that can be quickly grasped, even when scanning.
- **Color, Image, and Video Independence:** Guarantee your message remains clear without relying on visual elements.
- **Structured Markup:** Maintain clean and organized markup for accessibility.
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Ensure compatibility with mobile devices, which increasingly serve as core communication tools.

Many of our accessibility writing practices align with those for [educational content](/08-writing-educational-content.html.md), with added considerations for markup, syntax, and structure.

## Writing Guidelines

### Avoid Directional Language

Refrain from using directional instructions or language that assumes knowledge of page layout or design. This ensures flexibility, particularly for mobile layout changes.

- Prefer: "Select from these options" (with steps listed)
- Avoid: "Select from the options in the right sidebar."

### Use Headers

Maintain a consistent header hierarchy. Never skip header levels for stylistic reasons. Use H1 for the page title, H2 for top-level sections, and H3 and beyond for subsequent sections. Avoid excessive nesting.

### Establish Hierarchy

Prioritize placing essential information first. Group related topics within paragraphs and distinguish different subjects with headings. Start with a simple outline to create a logical hierarchy, enhancing scannability and comprehension.

Opt for true lists rather than paragraphs or line breaks.

### Label Forms

Clearly label input fields with appropriate names and tags. Thoughtfully consider field necessity, especially marking required fields distinctly. Shorter forms are preferred.

### Use Descriptive Links

Link text should convey information about the linked action or destination. Avoid generic phrases like "click here" or "learn more."

### Employ Plain Language

Compose concise sentences using plain language and familiar words. Avoid jargon and slang. Explain abbreviations or acronyms upon first reference.

### Utilize Alt Text

Include alt text on all images, adapting its content to the image's purpose:
- For creative images, provide a detailed description in a brief caption.
- For functional images, describe the image's content thoroughly to ensure equal comprehension for those who can't view it.
- When sharing charts or graphs, incorporate data into the alt text.

Consider supplementing images with standard captions, recognizing that browsers handle alt tags differently.

### Ensure Closed Captioning

All videos should offer closed captioning or transcripts. The information presented in videos must also be accessible in alternative formats.

### Mind Visual Elements

Prioritize high-contrast font and background colors. Use tools in the resources section to select accessible colors. Avoid relying solely on images for communication, as images may not load or be visible.
