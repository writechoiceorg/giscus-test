## Date and time

Follow the standards below to ensure a consistent formatting convention for date and time.

### Date

- Spell out the names of months and days of the week in total. Only abbreviate if there is a space limitation. For example: January 19, 2017.

- If including the day of the week, add it before the month. For example: Tuesday, April 27, 2021.

### Time

- Use the 12-hour clock.

- Use hyphens in time ranges. Don't add spaces before or after the hyphens, such as 5—10 minutes ago.

- Capitalize AM and PM, and leave one space between it and the time. For example: 3:45 PM.

- Remove the minutes from round hours, such as 3 PM.

### Dates and time together

When expressing the date and time together, it's best to mention the date first and then the time:

- 2017—04—15 at 3 PM
- May 4, 2009, at 6 PM

### Time zones

In cases where you need to use a time zone, use the following guidelines:

- Let the reader know if the time is local to their time.

  - 10 AM your local time.

- If using a specific time zone, spell out the region and include the [UTC or GMT label](https://www.worldtimeserver.com/learn/utc-vs-gmt/).

  - US and Canadian Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7)
