## Images and graphs

Images and graphs are powerful resources to assist in understanding processes and technologies. Otherwise, observing some critical points is crucial, for these resources don't negatively compromise your content.

- *Choose simple and clear images* and remove anything unnecessary, and be careful with crops. If the image has important information, add [alt text](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images).

- *Remember that your customer's screen may be small*, so keep your content easy to read.

- *Be detail-oriented when creating infographics*. Provide a way for viewers to zoom in on specific areas. Or, present individual sections of the infographic within the text, and provide a link to the full infographic.

- *Simplify charts and graphs* so readers can easily read the whole thing on a small screen.

- *Ensure it can be easy to edit when using text in graphics*. Automatic translation software can't translate it, so it would be best to use captions or describe the graphic in the text if possible.

## Use of examples

To provide an example in a sentence, refer to the guidance below.

- At the end of a sentence, use a comma or an em dash.

| :x: &nbsp; Not recommended                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id, for example, user-10.  |

 :x: &nbsp; Not recommended                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id, for example; user-10.  |

| :+1: &nbsp; Recommended                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id, such as user-10.   |

| :+1: &nbsp; Recommended                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id. For example: user-10.   |

| :+1: &nbsp; Recommended                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id (for example, user-10).   |


- In the middle of a sentence, use parentheses if the example is short. Otherwise, rewrite the sentence.

| :x: &nbsp; Not recommended                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id (for example, a string including your user Id like user-10), and then click **Next**.  |

| :+1: &nbsp; Recommended                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Insert a value for the key Id (for example, user-10), and then click **Next**  |
