## Headings

Headings can provide structure and visual cues that make it easier for readers to scan and navigate. By dividing your text into logical sections, the extra spacing and distinct font sizes to headings will help readers find entry points and locate information efficiently.

Essential things to consider while writing headings:

- *Use brief headings*. It's crucial to prioritize the most significant idea and place it at the beginning. Avoid exceeding 6â€”8 words in headings.

- *Be specific and detailed when creating headings*, especially second-level headings which should provide even more specific information.

- *Concentrate on what matters to customers*, and use customer-friendly language in headings. Avoid mentioning products or commands (unless it's the goal) and focus on what customers need to know or accomplish.

- *Format headings with sentence-style capitalization*. Capitalize the first word, proper nouns, and the first word after a colon (if there is one). Keep everything else in lowercase. Some examples below:

  - Control your features with WRITECHOICE docs
  - Speed up the deployment process
  - Find a solution
  - Use Bayesian probabilities on A/B tests
  - WRITECHOICE docs: Better decisions with data

### Using Headings as step-by-step guides

Headings serve as a valuable tool for simplifying intricate processes or tasks into manageable, step-by-step instructions. When employing headings to construct these instructions, adhere to the following guidelines to guarantee clarity and effectiveness:

- *Include "Step N:" at the beginning of heading*: Clearly indicate to the reader that each section represents a step in the process, following the format shown below:

  - Step 1: Start with a Clear Title
  - Step 2: Use Action-Oriented Language
  - Step 3: Keep it Short and Sweet
