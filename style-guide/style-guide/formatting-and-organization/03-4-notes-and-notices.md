## Notes and notices

Use a notice to provide useful or crucial information that isn't part of the main text. However, has been noticed that readers often ignore elements such as notices that don't pertain to their interests or focus. After writing information in regular text, evaluate if it's necessary to highlight it as a notice.

- *Don't use many notices on a single page*. It can make them less noticeable. Find alternative ways to communicate information, especially if there are multiple notices in a row.

- *Avoid grouping multiple notices*. If necessary, reorganize the content for clarity.

### Notices types

When you decide to provide notice, try using these types:

- **Note**. It's a quick suggestion or tip. Offers helpful information that may be optional but can still be valuable to the reader. For example:

  > **Note**
  >
  > When making API calls, always include the appropriate authentication credentials in the request headers to ensure secure and authorized access to the API endpoints.

- **Warning**. It means "Don't do this" or that this step might be irreversible, such as leading to permanent data loss. Ignoring the warning could result in financial loss, loss of work, or a security breach for the reader. For example:

  > **Warning**
  >
  > Avoid including passwords as command line arguments when conducting A/B software tests with APIs. Storing sensitive information in this manner poses a significant security risk. Instead, utilize secure authentication methods and token-based access to protect confidential data.
