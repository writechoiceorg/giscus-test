## Numbers

To avoid confusion, always use consistent numbering. If you are referring to numbers displayed in the user interface (UI), replicate them exactly. For all other content, refer to the guidelines provided.

In body text, spell out whole numbers from zero through nine, and use numerals for 10 or greater. It's OK to use numerals for zero through nine when you have limited space, such as in tables and UI.

If one item requires a numeral, use numerals for all the other items of that type. For example: One guide has 20 section, second has 5 sections, and the third has only 1 section.

When two numbers that refer to different things must appear together, use a numeral for one and spell out the other. For example: Ten 10-section guides.

Don't start a sentence with a numeral. Add a modifier before the number, or spell the number out if you can't rewrite the sentence. It's OK to start list items with numeralsâ€”use your judgment.
