## Lists

Lists are essential for organizing information and making it more readable. Follow these guidelines when using lists in your documentation:

### Bullet Points

Bullet points are suitable for listing items in no particular order. Use bullet points when:

- Enumerating a list of items without any inherent sequence or priority.
- Presenting options, features, or examples in a non-hierarchical format.
- Breaking down complex ideas into digestible chunks.

Example:
- Key features of our product include:
  - Real-time analytics
  - Customizable dashboard
  - Mobile app integration

### Numbered Lists

Numbered lists are ideal when you want to indicate a specific sequence, priority, or steps to follow. Use numbered lists when:

1. Describing a process with sequential steps.
2. Providing instructions that must be followed in a specific order.
3. Highlighting a hierarchy or priority within a list.

Example:
1. To install the software, follow these steps:
   a. Download the installation file.
   b. Run the installer.
   c. Accept the license agreement.
   d. Choose the installation directory.
   e. Click "Install."

### Combining Lists

In some cases, you may need to combine both bullet points and numbered lists within your documentation. Ensure clarity and consistency when doing so:

- Use bullet points for general information or non-sequential lists.
- Use numbered lists when a specific order or sequence is necessary.

Example:
- Steps to troubleshoot common issues:
   1. Check network connectivity.
   2. Restart the application.
   - Additional tips:
     - Clear browser cache.
     - Update to the latest version.

### Formatting Tips

Regardless of the type of list you use, follow these formatting tips:

- Start each list item with a capital letter.
- Use consistent punctuation (periods, semicolons, or none) at the end of list items.
- Maintain a parallel structure, ensuring that all list items are of the same grammatical form (for example, all nouns or all imperative verbs).
