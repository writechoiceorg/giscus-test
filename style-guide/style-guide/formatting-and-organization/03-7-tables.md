## Tables

Tables simplify complex information by presenting it in a structured format. Typically, tables contain two or more rows and two or more columns. Avoid using tables for presenting a list of similar items; instead, use a list.

Keep in mind some things when structuring a table:

- *Make sure the table is clear*. You can use a title or brief intro.

- *Put identifying information in the leftmost column* of a table for easy understanding.

- *To ensure consistency, align the entries in a table*. This means using the same format for all items within a column, such as using only nouns or phrases that start with a verb.

- *Use sentence-style capitalization* for the table title and each column header. Use sentence-style capitalization for the text in cells unless there's a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be lowercase).

- *Don't leave cells blank or use em dashes*. Use "Not applicable" or "None" instead.

- *For better design, use responsive content*. Keep limited columns and one-line text per cell.

- *Balance row height* by increasing the width of text-heavy columns and reducing the width of columns with minimal text.
