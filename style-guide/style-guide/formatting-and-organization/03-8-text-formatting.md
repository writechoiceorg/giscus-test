## Text-formatting

This page offers a summary and quick reference for various general text-formatting conventions.

### Bold

- Use bold, `<b>` or `**`, for user interface elements and at the beginning of notices.

### Italic

- Use italics, `<i>` or `*`, to highlight words or phrases when defining terms or referring to words.

- Parameter names, data, and count. For example, when you refer to the parameters of a method like *keyAccount*.

- Mathematical variables and version variables. For example, *x + y = 3*, version 1.4.*x*.

- To indicate semantic emphasis in HTML, use the `<em>` element, which renders as italics in most contexts. To indicate emphasis in Markdown, use <code> * </code>, which render as italics; you can't do semantic tagging in Markdown.

### Code font

- Use `<code>` in HTML or <code>`</code> in Markdown to apply a monospace font and other styling to code in text, inline code, and user input.

- Use code blocks, `<pre>` or <code>```</code>, for code samples or other blocks of code.

- Use code font to mark up code, such as filenames, class names, method names, HTTP status codes, console output, and placeholders.
